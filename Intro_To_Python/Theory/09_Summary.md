# Summary
* Everything in python is declared by assignment
* Python supports Dynamic typing
* Variables in Python are declared by assigning to them
* A variable cannopt be used before it is assigned to
* The Python convention for variable names is all_lower_case_words_with_underscores
* Python supports three numeric types: integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers
* Python supports four types of sequences, strings, bytes, lists and tuples
* Python supports two mapping types: sets and dictionaries
* Dictionaries are mapped sets of values. Dictionary keys must be hashable
* Sets are similar to dictionaries but contain only keys. A set is an unique collection of values. There are two types - the normal set is dynamic (mutable) and a frozenset is fixed (immutable)
* In python, modules must be imported before their contents may be accessed. Variables, functions and classes must be declared before they can be used
* There are 3 main IO methods in python, print, open and input
* The conditional statement in python is IF
* There are two kinds of loops in python, the WHILE loop is used for reading data, typically from a database or other data source or when waiting for user input to end a loop
* The FOR loop is used to iterate through a sequence of data
* Builtin functions can be applied to many different data types but not all functions can be applied to all data types
