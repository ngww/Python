| `>`      | Greater than                 | `2 > 3`  #=> False           |
| `<`      | Less than                    | `2 < 3`  #=> True            |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to      | `2 >= 3` #=> False           |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to         | `2 <= 3` #=> True            |
| `and`    | Logical AND                  | `True and False` #=> False   |
| `or`     | Logical OR                   | `True or False`  #=> True    |
| `not`    | Logical NOT                  | `not True`       #=> False   |
| `=`      | Assignment                   | `x = 5`                     |
| `+=`     | Addition assignment          | `x += 3`   (equivalent to `x = x + 3`) |
| `-=`     | Subtraction assignment       | `x -= 2`   (equivalent to `x = x - 2`) |
| `*=`     | Multiplication assignment    | `x *= 2`   (equivalent to `x = x * 2`) |
| `/=`     | Division assignment          | `x /= 2`   (equivalent to `x = x / 2`) |
| `//=`    | Floor division assignment    | `x //= 2`  (equivalent to `x = x // 2`)|
| `%=`     | Modulo assignment            | `x %= 3`   (equivalent to `x = x % 3`) |
| `**=`    | Exponentiation assignment    | `x **= 2`  (equivalent to `x = x ** 2`)|
| `and=`   | Logical AND assignment       | `x and= y` (equivalent to `x = x and y`)|
| `or=`    | Logical OR assignment        | `x or= y`  (equivalent to `x = x or y`) |
| `not=`   | Logical NOT assignment       | `not= x`   (equivalent to `x = not x`)  |

# Slicing Syntax
Certainly! Here's a table listing the syntax for slicing in Python:

| Syntax           | Description                           | Example                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `sequence[start:]` | Slice from start to the end           | `sequence[2:]`                |
| `sequence[:stop]` | Slice from the beginning to stop-1    | `sequence[:5]`                |
| `sequence[start:stop]` | Slice from start to stop-1         | `sequence[2:5]`                |
| `sequence[start:stop:step]` | Slice from start to stop-1 with a step size | `sequence[1:10:2]`        |
| `sequence[::-1]` | Reverse the sequence                  | `sequence[::-1]`              |

In the table above, `sequence` represents the list, tuple, string, or any other sequence-like object that you want to slice.

Here are some examples illustrating the usage of slicing syntax:

```python
my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
my_tuple = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
my_string = "Hello, World!"

print(my_list[2:])               # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(my_tuple[:5])               # Output: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
print(my_string[7:12])            # Output: World
print(my_list[1:8:2])             # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7]
print(my_string[::-1])            # Output: !dlroW ,olleH
```

The slicing syntax allows you to extract specific elements or subsequences from a sequence based on the specified start, stop, and step values. It provides a flexible way to work with sequences in Python.
