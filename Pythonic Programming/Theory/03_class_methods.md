# Class Methods
In Python, class methods are methods that are bound to the class rather than an instance of the class. They are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator. Class methods can be called on the class itself or on instances of the class. The first parameter of a class method is typically named `cls` (short for class), which represents the class itself.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to create and use class methods:

```python
class MyClass:
    class_attribute = 10

    def __init__(self, instance_attribute):
        self.instance_attribute = instance_attribute

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print(f"This is a class method of {cls.__name__}")
        print(f"Class attribute value: {cls.class_attribute}")

    def instance_method(self):
        print("This is an instance method")
        print(f"Instance attribute value: {self.instance_attribute}")

# Accessing a class method on the class itself
MyClass.class_method()
```

Output:
```
This is a class method of MyClass
Class attribute value: 10
```

In this example, we define a class named `MyClass` with a class method named `class_method`. The `@classmethod` decorator is used to indicate that it's a class method. Inside the class method, we can access class attributes using the `cls` parameter.

To call a class method, you can use the class name followed by the method name: `ClassName.class_method()`. In this case, we call the `class_method` directly on the `MyClass` class.

Class methods can also be called on instances of the class. When called on an instance, the instance is passed as the `cls` parameter automatically:

```python
# Creating an instance of MyClass
my_object = MyClass(20)

# Accessing the class method on an instance
my_object.class_method()
```

Output:
```
This is a class method of MyClass
Class attribute value: 10
```

In this case, when we call `my_object.class_method()`, the instance `my_object` is automatically passed as the `cls` parameter to the class method.

Note that class methods can't access instance attributes directly because they are not bound to a specific instance. However, they can access class attributes and perform operations that are relevant to the class as a whole.

Class methods are useful when you want to define methods that operate on class-level data or perform actions related to the class itself, rather than individual instances.
