# Monkey Patching
Monkey patching is a technique in Python that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of an object at runtime by dynamically changing its attributes or methods. It involves adding, replacing, or modifying attributes or methods of an existing object or class without altering its original implementation.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to perform monkey patching:

```python
class MyClass:
    def my_method(self):
        return "Original behavior"

# Create an instance of MyClass
obj = MyClass()

# Define a new method to be patched in
def new_method(self):
    return "Patched behavior"

# Monkey patching - replacing my_method with new_method
obj.my_method = new_method

# Test the patched behavior
print(obj.my_method())  # Output: Patched behavior
```

In this example, we have a `MyClass` with an original `my_method` method. To perform monkey patching, we define a new method called `new_method`. Then, we assign `new_method` to the `my_method` attribute of the `obj` instance, effectively replacing the original method.

After monkey patching, when we call `obj.my_method()`, it invokes the patched behavior defined in `new_method` instead of the original behavior.

Monkey patching can be applied not only to individual objects but also to entire classes. Here's an example:

```python
class OriginalClass:
    def original_method(self):
        return "Original behavior"

# Define a new method to be patched in
def patched_method(self):
    return "Patched behavior"

# Monkey patching - replacing original_method with patched_method
OriginalClass.original_method = patched_method

# Create an instance of the class
obj = OriginalClass()

# Test the patched behavior
print(obj.original_method())  # Output: Patched behavior
```

In this example, we monkey patch the `OriginalClass` by replacing its `original_method` with `patched_method`. When we create an instance of the class and call `original_method()`, it invokes the patched behavior instead of the original behavior.

Monkey patching can be a powerful technique to modify the behavior of objects or classes at runtime. However, it should be used judiciously and with caution, as it can make code harder to understand, maintain, and debug. It's important to document monkey patches thoroughly and consider potential implications and conflicts with other parts of the codebase.
