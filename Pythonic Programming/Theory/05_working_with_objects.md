Working with objects created from classes involves accessing their attributes, calling their methods, and interacting with them to perform desired operations. Here are some common operations you can perform with objects:

1. Accessing Attributes:
   You can access the attributes of an object using the dot notation (`object.attribute`). For example:
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age

   # Creating an object (instance) of the Person class
   person = Person("Alice", 25)

   # Accessing attributes
   print(person.name)  # Output: Alice
   print(person.age)   # Output: 25
   ```

2. Calling Methods:
   You can call the methods defined in a class on objects using the dot notation (`object.method()`). For example:
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name):
           self.name = name

       def say_hello(self):
           print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}.")

   # Creating an object of the Person class
   person = Person("Alice")

   # Calling the say_hello method
   person.say_hello()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice.
   ```

3. Modifying Attributes:
   You can modify the attributes of an object by assigning new values to them using the dot notation. For example:
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name):
           self.name = name

   # Creating an object of the Person class
   person = Person("Alice")

   # Modifying the name attribute
   person.name = "Bob"
   print(person.name)  # Output: Bob
   ```

4. Creating Multiple Objects:
   You can create multiple objects (instances) of a class, each with its own set of attributes and behavior. For example:
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name):
           self.name = name

       def say_hello(self):
           print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}.")

   # Creating two objects of the Person class
   person1 = Person("Alice")
   person2 = Person("Bob")

   # Calling methods on each object
   person1.say_hello()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice.
   person2.say_hello()  # Output: Hello, my name is Bob.
   ```

These are just a few examples of how to work with objects created from classes. Depending on the class and its behavior, you can perform various operations, manipulate attributes, call methods, and interact with the objects to achieve the desired functionality.
