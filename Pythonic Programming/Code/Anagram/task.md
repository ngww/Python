# Anagram

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word.
Given a word and a list of candidates, select the sublist of anagrams of the given word.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run `pytest anagram_test.py`

Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module:
`python -m pytest anagram_test.py`
