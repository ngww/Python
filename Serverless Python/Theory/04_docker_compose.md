Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the services, networks, and volumes required for your application's containers.

With Docker Compose, you can specify the configuration of your application's services, including their images, environment variables, ports, volumes, and dependencies. You can then use the Docker Compose command-line interface (CLI) to start, stop, and manage your application as a single unit.

Here's a basic example of a Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) that defines a simple web application:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - '80:80'
    volumes:
      - ./app:/usr/share/nginx/html
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=myapp
      - MYSQL_USER=myuser
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

In this example, we have two services: `web` and `db`. The `web` service uses the latest Nginx image, maps port 80 on the host to port 80 in the container, mounts the `./app` directory as the web server's document root, and specifies that it depends on the `db` service. The `db` service uses the latest MySQL image, sets some environment variables for the database configuration, and will be automatically started before the `web` service.

To use Docker Compose, make sure you have Docker installed on your system. Then, navigate to the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located and run the following command to start your application:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start the defined services and output their logs to the console. You can add the `-d` flag (`docker-compose up -d`) to run the containers in detached mode, which means they will run in the background.

There are many more features and options available in Docker Compose, such as networking, environment variables, scaling, and more. You can refer to the official Docker Compose documentation for further details and advanced usage: https://docs.docker.com/compose/
