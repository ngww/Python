# Python Data Types
Python supports several built-in data types that are commonly used to store and manipulate data. Here are some of the fundamental data types in Python:

* Integer (int): Used to represent whole numbers, both positive and negative. For example: x = 10.

* Floating-point number (float): Used to represent decimal numbers. For example: pi = 3.14.

* String (str): Used to represent a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes (') or double quotes ("). For example: **name = "John"**.

* Boolean (bool): Represents either true or false. The two possible values are **True** and **False**. For example: **is_true = True**.

* List: A mutable, ordered collection of items enclosed in square brackets ([]). Lists can contain elements of different data types. For example: **numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]**.

* Tuple: An immutable, ordered collection of items enclosed in parentheses (()). Tuples can contain elements of different data types. For example: **point = (3, 4)**.

* Dictionary: An unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces ({}). Keys are unique within a dictionary, and they are used to access corresponding values. For example: person = **{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}**.

* Set: An unordered collection of unique elements enclosed in curly braces ({}). Duplicates are not allowed in sets. For example: **fruits = {"apple", "banana", "orange"}**.

* None: Represents the absence of a value. It is commonly used to indicate the absence of a return value or an uninitialized variable. For example: **result = None**.

These are some of the primary data types in Python. Python also provides additional data types such as bytes, byte array, range, etc. Additionally, you can create your own custom data types using classes and objects.
