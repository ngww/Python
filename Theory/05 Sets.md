# Sets
In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are used when you want to store a collection of items where duplicates are not allowed and the order of the elements is not important. Sets are created by enclosing comma-separated values within curly braces `{ }` or by using the `set()` function.

Here are some examples of using sets in Python:

```python
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "orange"}      # Creating a set of fruits
numbers = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])               # Creating a set from a list
mixed = set([1, "apple", True, 3.14])        # Creating a set with mixed data types

print(fruits)                               # Output: {"apple", "banana", "orange"}
print(numbers)                              # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(mixed)                                # Output: {1, "apple", True, 3.14}

# Adding elements to a set
fruits.add("grape")                         # Adding a single element
numbers.update([6, 7, 8])                    # Adding multiple elements

# Removing elements from a set
fruits.remove("banana")                      # Removing a specific element
numbers.discard(1)                           # Removing an element (if present)
popped_item = fruits.pop()                   # Removing and returning an arbitrary element

# Set operations
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

union = set1.union(set2)                     # Union of two sets
intersection = set1.intersection(set2)       # Intersection of two sets
difference = set1.difference(set2)           # Set difference (elements in set1 but not in set2)
symmetric_difference = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)  # Symmetric difference (elements in either set, but not in both)

# Set membership check
print(3 in set1)                            # Output: True

# Iterating over a set
for element in fruits:
    print(element)

```

These examples demonstrate various operations and methods that can be performed on sets in Python. Sets allow you to add and remove elements, perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference, check for membership, and iterate over the elements in the set.

Sets are particularly useful when you want to store a collection of unique elements and perform operations such as finding common elements, removing duplicates, or testing for membership efficiently.
